/*-------------README---------------------------------------------------------//
*
* Alright! Let's compile our first programin C++! 
*
* You might have already noticed my weird heading and such for this README file,
* it is common practice to start every C++ file with some sort of heading that 
* lets people know the purpose of the file and what it is intended to do. This
* entire space is a long comment that will be ignored when you actually run the
* code in a C++ environment. how do I know? It started with the following 
* symbols: "/*". Look at the very, very top and you'll see them. At the end of
* This box, you will also see these guys: "*/". They let the compiler know that
* the long comment has finished. 
*
* You can also comment out the rest of individual lines by using the following
* symbols: "//". You will see them used soon enough. 
*
* Now back to the heading! This type of heading established the number of 
* characters in a given line before you reach the end of the end of traditional
* terminal line space and the line will wrap around to the next line.
* Why is that important? It really isn't. In fact, it's kinda just tradition,
* I still do it, though, because I use a terminal to code in. It's kinda 
* annoying to have my line cut in half when I have to copy and paste it later on
*
* You have probably noticed that at the start of each of these lines, there is 
* an asterisk ('*'). This doesn't need to be there. I include it for clarity.
* And I hear what you are thinking,
* "Clarity? Who cares if a code is clear, so long as it works!"
* The answer, of course, is obvious:
* "Everyone else."
*
* You see, unless you are a fairly competent computational scientists, most
* code nowadays is developed my multiple people at once. This means that your
* code will be seen by just about everyone in your immediate party. If they 
* can't figure out what you are trying to say or do... well, good luck. You will
* end up having quite a few unnecessary conversations. 
*
* But I am getting ahead of myself, these are all tricks to the trade you will 
* learn eventually. For now, let's get started with your first code!
