So, here's the scenario: you live in Japan and in a decade, the Japanese 
government wants to get rid of all the cats on Tashirojima, the cat island. 
Well, for a human, this is a simple process that takes a very, very long time.
You just have to gather the cats, put them in boxes and ship them to Russia...
Or wherever it is you want to ship them. Because it takes so long to find all 
the cats, you are thinking about making a robot that does the boxing for you.
All the robot needs to do is take the cats you give it and place those cats in 
a box. Once a box is full, the robot will then throw the box into the back of a 
truck. Simple, right? 

Well, it would be simple if your robot was a little human servant, but 
unfortunately, it's not. It's a robot. Standard logical rules apply. Throughout
this upcoming week, I'll be updating this repository every other day with new
approximations your robot could make to send as many cats as possible to Russia.

Or wherever you want to send them. I won't judge.

Anyway, the first code will be committed to this repository Wednesday, so feel
free to come by and check it out!
