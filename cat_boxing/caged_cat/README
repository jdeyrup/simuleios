Yeah, yeah. I hear what you are saying. The fluid cat approximation does not 
make a lot of sense. In reality, you are completely right. I mean, even if we
sedated all the cats so they do not kill each other in their boxes, the cats 
will still poo and pee all over the other cats, preading all sorts of diseases
and unwanted materials. You might not care too much about that, but there are 
some organizations that do. So we might as well clean up our act now so the 
Japanese government does not look like a bunch of brutes.

So, how do we do this? Well, whenever a cat comes along the conveyer belt, we
find it's volume and then find an appropriately sized cage for the cat. 
This part should be simple. When a cat is small, it's placed in a small cage.
When it is large, it is placed in a large cage, and when it is somewhere 
in-between, it is placed in a medium-sized cage. It's as simple as that...

Unfortunately, this makes it incredibly challening to place all the boxes 
appropriately in the truck. I mean, with the fluid cat approximation, we just 
assumed that 40 boxes could fit in the truck. In this case each box has a 
volume that is not necessarily equal to the volume of the other boxes in the
truck. This means there needs to be some sort of planning in how the robot
places the boxes in the truck. This planning takes a good deal of rational
thought (even if you are human), which means it will be doubly difficult to 
figure out how to write a code to simulate that logic. 

Let's see what we can do!
