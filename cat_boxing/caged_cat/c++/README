So, here are the steps to get the code to work out appropriately:

1. Generate random cat.

2. Place cat in appropriately sized box

3. figure out optimum packing scheme in truck

4. Place boxes in truck.

Sounds easy, right? Well, step 3's a bit tough.

Also: You might have noticed a fe more files in this directory than normal, that
is because I have included the slim version of the fluid cat approximation and
an additional header file to link the functions we made last time to the file we
are writing this time: "caged_cat.cpp".

Good luck!
