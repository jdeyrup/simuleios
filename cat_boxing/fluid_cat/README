Let's start with a simple approximation, one that seems logical my some 
accounts: the case of fluid cats. 

I mean, think about it. Have you ever seen a cat perfectly fill any container it
finds? No? Well, I have. For this reason, pretending cats are fluids might not
be too bad of an approximation, and it is certainly one that is easy to model

For this lesson, all we are doing is creating a code that will place cats into
boxes. Once the cats are in boxes, the code will then place the boxes in a 
truck, but this should be quite simple -- especially considering that we are 
approximating the truck to be completely filled (with no empty space) once we 
place a given number of boxes in it. This means that our little robot executing
our code can just place the boxes in by filling all the space in the x, y, and z
directions. Hopefully this shouldn't be too tricky.

Even placing the cats in the boxes will not be too difficult. I mean, we just 
need to find the cat's weight to find it's mass and turn that mass into a 
volume. Once done, we throw it into a box with other cats. If there are too 
many cats in a box, a new box is opened and cats are placed in that one. 

Now, when I say something is "simple," that does not mean it is "easy." Those 
are two very different things. Please keep this in mind when learning to code.
Just because something is conceptually simple, that does not necessarily mean
it is easy to do. 

All that said, let's get to it! I have directories for C++, Fortran, and Python,
and a copy of the necessary code in each one.

I hope it is easy to follow from here! Let me know if it's not!
