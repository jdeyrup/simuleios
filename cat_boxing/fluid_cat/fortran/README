!
! Alright! Let's write some code to simulate fluid cats in baxes! 
!
! This code can be split into the following parts:
! 
! 1. Generation of randomly sized cats
! 
! 2. Placement of cats in box
! 
! 3. Placement of box in truck.
!
! we will be making the following assumptions:
! 
! 1. Cat density is a defined property (it is not in real life, but who cares?)
!
! 2. The boxes are all the same size
!
! 3. The boxes perfectly fit in the back of the truck
!
! I think that's all for now, so let's move on to the actual code!
!
! Remember your compile instructions! 
!
!    gfortran fluid_cat.f95 -o fluid_cats
!    ./fluid_cats
!
! Good Luck!
!
