! Alright! Let's compile our first program in fortran! 
!
! You might have already noticed my weird heading and such for this README file,
! it is common practice to start every fortran file with a heading that 
! lets people know the purpose of the file and what it is intended to do. This
! entire space is a long comment that will be ignored when you actually run the
! code in a fortran environment. how do I know? It started with the following 
! symbol: "!". So does every line in this block, actually. 
!
! Now back to the heading! This type of heading establishes the number of 
! characters in a given line before you reach the end of a traditional
! terminal's line space and the line will wrap around to the next line.
! Why is that important? It really isn't. In fact, it's kinda just tradition,
! I still do it, though, because I use a terminal to code in. It's kinda 
! annoying to have my line cut in half when I have to copy and paste it later on
!
! Another advantage of a long heading like this is clarity.
! And I hear what you are thinking,
! "Clarity? Who cares if a code is clear, so long as it works!"
! The answer, of course, is obvious:
! "Everyone else."
!
! You see, unless you are a fairly competent computational scientist, most
! code nowadays is developed my multiple people at once. This means that your
! code will be seen by just about everyone in your immediate party. If they 
! can't figure out what you are trying to say or do... well, good luck. You will
! end up having quite a few unnecessary conversations. 
!
! But I am getting ahead of myself, these are all tricks to the trade you will 
! learn eventually. For now, let's get started with your first code!
