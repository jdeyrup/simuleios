#-------------hello_world.py---------------------------------------------------#
#
# In most traditional coding courses, they start with a simple program that 
# outputs "Hello World!" to the terminal. Luckily, in python... this is pretty
# simple. In fact, it's only one line (the line that follows this long comment).#
# You should be able to type in:
#
# python hello_world.py
#
# and receive the following output in your terminal:
#
# Hello World!
#
# So let's get to it!
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

print("Hello World!")

# In python, the "print" command sends whatever is in the parentheses to your 
# terminal. That's precisely what we are doing. Sending "Hello World!" to the
# terminal. Let me know if you have any trouble!
