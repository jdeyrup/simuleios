For this assignment, we are approximating the time it would take for a ball to 
fall to the ground from a distance of 5 meters. I know this can be solved 
analytically, which is precisely why it is the first homework assignment!

Here is the equation you will need for a rough approximation:

x = x - 0.5*9.81*t*t

Note: This is only a rough approximation and will not provide accurate results
unless you choose the exact correct time step. Why is it not accurate? Well, 
because we do not take into account the changing velocity! Here is the 
formula for velocity:

v = v + 9.81*t

You should be able to update both in the same while loop, which should provide 
an appropriate solution (with a bit of error depending on your timestep).

Update: There are at least two solutions to this problem. One uses the velocity
to keep track of the ball's position, the other finds the correct timestep to
solve the acceleration equation directly.
