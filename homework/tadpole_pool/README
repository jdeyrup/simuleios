Let's say you are a biologist who has a little computational knowledge and have
created a little robot to scour Lake Idonwannacode for frogs of all different 
stages of development. As the robot goes around the pond, you notice it is not
counting the frogs properly! Your job is to write a function that can properly
bin the data this robot collects. By this, I mean that your code should be able
to accept the age of a frog and output the stage of development the frog is in.
Your code should then count how many frogs are in each stage of development.

Here are the stages of development we consider:
    1. Egg
    2. Tadpole
    3. Tadpole with legs
    4. Frog with tail
    5. Adult frog

In this assignment, I have created a function for you to use in the file 
"frog_found.py". This file will randomly pull a frog from the appropriate 
distribution of frogs in a pond and output that frog's age. Please use this
function in your code. If you don't, I will not penalize you, but it will be 
best for everyone if you did.
